## 1. About 
Hangman is a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words. Users have 10 
chances to guess the word by using the keyboard to guess a letter from the word. If the chosen letter exists in the answer, then all positions where the letter appears will be revealed. Otherwise, the number of chances is decremented and the incorrect letter is displayed.

## 2. Getting Started
This project can be run by opening and running the `index.html` file in a live server.
